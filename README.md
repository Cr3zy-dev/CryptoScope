## üìä How the Confidence Score Works

CryptoScope‚Äôs **Confidence Score (0‚Äì100)** now leverages a significantly upgraded, machine-generated algorithm to reflect a coin's short- to mid-term potential with higher accuracy. It considers:

-   **üìâ Short-Term Trends:** 24h and 7d price changes.
-   **üìà Mid-Term Trends:** 30-day price movement for historical context.
-   **üìä Market Cap Rank:** Higher-ranked coins are weighted slightly more favorably.
-   **üíπ Volume/Market Cap Ratio:** High ratios imply stronger market activity and liquidity.
-   **‚ö° Technical Indicators:** Integrates SMA, RSI, and MACD for a comprehensive view of momentum, volatility, and trend strength.

> A higher score implies stronger bullish momentum; a lower score indicates bearish or unclear conditions, driven by a more robust data-driven analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a machine-generated score - not financial advice.
