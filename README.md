## üìä How the Confidence Score Works

CryptoScope‚Äôs **Confidence Score (0‚Äì100)** reflects algorithmic confidence in a coin's short- to mid-term potential:

- **üìâ Short-Term Trends:** 24h and 7d price changes.
- **üìà Mid-Term Trends:** 30-day price movement adds historical context.
- **üìä Market Cap Rank:** Higher-ranked coins are weighted slightly more favorably.
- **üíπ Volume/Market Cap Ratio:** High ratios imply stronger market activity and liquidity.

> A higher score implies bullish momentum; a lower score indicates bearish or unclear conditions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a machine-generated score - not financial advice.
